# Todos with React and FlowRouter

We will convert the 'simple-todos-react' project to a full version 'todos-react', step by step, following the [Meteor Guide](http://guide.meteor.com/) for 
the best practice.

1. Step1 : Abstract the todos-lib package to gather the common dependencies of all app packages.
2. Step2 : Abstract the todos-main package for the entry point of the app, which require all other packages.
